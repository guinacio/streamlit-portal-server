## Architecture

### System Overview
The Streamlit Portal uses a multi-component architecture that ensures secure, scalable application management:

- **Portal Server** (Port 8501): Main application for user management and authentication
- **Proxy Server** (Port 8000): Secure app access with session validation
- **Database Layer**: SQLite database for user data and session management
- **Streamlit Applications** (Port 8502+): Individual apps with integrated security

### Application Flow
The following sequence diagram illustrates the complete user journey from login to secure app access:

![Sequence Diagram](images/sequence_diagram.svg)

### Key Security Checkpoints
1. **Authentication**: User login with bcrypt password validation
2. **Session Management**: Secure cookie-based session tracking
3. **Permission Validation**: Group-based app access control
4. **Token Generation**: Single-use access tokens with session binding
5. **Proxy Validation**: Multi-layer security verification
6. **App Protection**: Individual app security with ID validation

## Network Configuration

### Multi-User Network Setup

For teams and enterprise environments where multiple users need access:

**Network Requirements:**
- **Same Network**: The server hosting the portal must be on the same local network (LAN) as the users
- **Port Access**: Ensure ports 8501 (portal) and 8000 (proxy) are accessible across the network
- **Firewall**: Configure firewall rules to allow traffic on these ports if needed

**Access Methods:**
- **Local Development**: `http://localhost:8501` (single machine)
- **Team Access**: `http://192.168.1.100:8501` (replace with your server's IP)
- **Corporate Network**: `http://10.0.1.50:8501` (corporate IP range)

**Finding Your Server IP:**
```bash
# On Windows
ipconfig

# On macOS/Linux  
ifconfig
# or
ip addr show
```

**Example Network Setup:**
```
Corporate Network (10.0.1.0/24)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Server: 10.0.1.50 (Running portal on port 8501)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User 1: 10.0.1.101 (Accesses http://10.0.1.50:8501)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ User 2: 10.0.1.102 (Accesses http://10.0.1.50:8501)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ User 3: 10.0.1.103 (Accesses http://10.0.1.50:8501)
```

**Security Considerations:**
- The portal automatically uses the server's IP for all internal communications
- All Streamlit apps must run on the same server for security and network access
- Apps are accessed through the secure proxy server (port 8000) with session validation

```

### Database Configuration
- **SQLite database** (`portal.db`) created automatically on first run
- **Automatic migrations** handle schema updates
- **Foreign key constraints** ensure data integrity
- **Indexed queries** for optimal performance

### Theme Customization
The portal uses a custom theme defined in `.streamlit/config.toml`:

```toml
[theme]
base = "light"
primaryColor = "#888888"           # Light gray for button text/interactions
backgroundColor = "#ffffff"        # Clean white background
secondaryBackgroundColor = "#f8f9fa"  # Subtle gray for cards
textColor = "#2c3e50"              # Professional dark gray
linkColor = "#2980b9"              # Theme blue for links
```

### Port Range Configuration
Modify the scanning range in `display_unregistered_ports()`:
```python
# Scan ports 8502-8600 (default)
unregistered_ports = scan_unregistered_ports_cached(8502, 8600, registered_ports)
```

### Categories Customization
Add new categories in `manage_apps_tab()`:
```python
category = st.selectbox("Category", 
    ["General", "Analytics", "ML/AI", "Dashboard", "Tools", "Games", "Your-Category"])
```

## Development & Testing

### Running Multiple Test Apps
Test the portal with multiple Streamlit applications:

1. **Create test applications**:
   ```bash
   mkdir test_apps && cd test_apps
   mkdir app1 app2 app3
   ```

2. **Create simple test apps**:
   ```python
   # test_apps/app1/main.py
   import streamlit as st
   st.title("Analytics Dashboard")
   st.write("Sample analytics application")
   st.bar_chart({"data": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]})
   ```

3. **Run on different ports**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   cd test_apps/app1 && streamlit run main.py --server.port 8502
   
   # Terminal 2  
   cd test_apps/app2 && streamlit run main.py --server.port 8503
   
   # Terminal 3
   cd test_apps/app3 && streamlit run main.py --server.port 8504
   ```

4. **Configure in portal**:
   - Login as admin
   - Use "Scan for Unregistered Apps" to auto-discover
   - Register apps with proper names, descriptions, and categories
   - Create user groups and set permissions
   - Test access with different user accounts

## Security Features

### Enterprise-Grade Security
The Streamlit Portal implements multiple layers of security to protect against unauthorized access and ensure safe application deployment in enterprise environments.

### Multi-Layer Authentication
- **Session-Based Security**: Advanced session management with secure token validation
- **Anti-Sharing Protection**: URLs cannot be shared between users or browsers
- **Automatic Token Expiration**: Access tokens expire automatically and are single-use only
- **Session Binding**: All access is cryptographically tied to authenticated portal sessions
- **Logout Protection**: When users log out, all their active sessions become invalid immediately

### Secure Access Control
- **Portal Session Validation**: Database-backed session verification prevents unauthorized access
- **Token-to-Session Binding**: Access tokens are permanently linked to the portal session that created them
- **Cross-Platform Security**: Works reliably across different browsers and devices
- **Non-Repudiation**: Clear audit trail of who accessed what and when

### Application Protection with App ID Security
Each Streamlit application can be secured using the included security library with mandatory app ID validation:

```python
from app_security import require_portal_access

# At the top of your Streamlit app (after page config)
require_portal_access(app_id=123)  # MUST match your app's ID from the portal database
```

**How App ID Security Works:**

1. **Portal Database Registration**: Each app registered in the portal gets a unique numeric ID
2. **Security Library Integration**: Apps use `app_security.py` with their specific app ID
3. **ID Matching Validation**: The portal validates that the requested app ID matches the authenticated session token
4. **Access Denial**: If app IDs don't match, access is immediately denied, if tokens don't match or are expired, denied

**Setting Up App Security:**

1. **Register your app** in the Portal Admin Panel ‚Üí Manage Apps
2. **Note the App ID** displayed in the management interface (see admin guide below)
3. **Add security to your Streamlit app:**
   ```python
   import streamlit as st
   from app_security import require_portal_access
   
   # Page config first
   st.set_page_config(page_title="My App", page_icon="üìä")
   
   # Security check with your app's ID - CRITICAL: Use the correct ID!
   require_portal_access(app_id=123)  # Replace 123 with your actual app ID
   
   # Your app code continues here
   st.title("My Secure Application")
   ```

4. **Deploy your app** on the port specified in the portal registration

**Security Benefits:**
- **Prevents unauthorized access** even with valid portal sessions
- **App-specific access control** - users can only access apps they have permissions for
- **ID spoofing protection** - apps cannot impersonate other applications
- **Database-backed validation** - all access is verified against the portal database
