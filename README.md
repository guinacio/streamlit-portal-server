## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Required packages** (automatically installed via requirements.txt)

### Installation

**Recommended: Using UV (Fast & Modern)**

1. **Install UV** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/guinacio/streamlit-portal-server.git
   cd streamlit-portal-server
   ```

3. **Install dependencies with UV**:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

4. **Run the portal**:
   ```bash
   uv run streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Access the portal**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

**Alternative: Using pip**

If you prefer using pip or don't want to install UV:

```bash
# After cloning the repository
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

> **💡 Why UV?** UV is significantly faster than pip, has better dependency resolution, and provides more reliable virtual environment management. It's the modern choice for Python package management.

### Default Admin Credentials
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`

⚠️ **Security Notice**: Change the default admin password immediately after first login!

├── portal.db              # SQLite database (auto-created)
└── README.md              # This documentation
```

### Database Configuration
- **SQLite database** (`portal.db`) created automatically on first run
- **Automatic migrations** handle schema updates
- **Foreign key constraints** ensure data integrity
- **Indexed queries** for optimal performance

### Theme Customization
The portal uses a custom theme defined in `.streamlit/config.toml`:

```toml
[theme]
base = "light"
primaryColor = "#888888"           # Light gray for button text/interactions
backgroundColor = "#ffffff"        # Clean white background
secondaryBackgroundColor = "#f8f9fa"  # Subtle gray for cards
textColor = "#2c3e50"              # Professional dark gray
linkColor = "#2980b9"              # Theme blue for links
```

### Port Range Configuration
Modify the scanning range in `display_unregistered_ports()`:
```python
# Scan ports 8502-8600 (default)
unregistered_ports = scan_unregistered_ports_cached(8502, 8600, registered_ports)
```

### Categories Customization
Add new categories in `manage_apps_tab()`:
```python
category = st.selectbox("Category", 
    ["General", "Analytics", "ML/AI", "Dashboard", "Tools", "Games", "Your-Category"])
```

## Development & Testing

### Running Multiple Test Apps
Test the portal with multiple Streamlit applications:

1. **Create test applications**:
   ```bash
   mkdir test_apps && cd test_apps
   mkdir app1 app2 app3
   ```

2. **Create simple test apps**:
   ```python
   # test_apps/app1/main.py
   import streamlit as st
   st.title("Analytics Dashboard")
   st.write("Sample analytics application")
   st.bar_chart({"data": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]})
   ```

3. **Run on different ports**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   cd test_apps/app1 && streamlit run main.py --server.port 8502
   
   # Terminal 2  
   cd test_apps/app2 && streamlit run main.py --server.port 8503
   
   # Terminal 3
   cd test_apps/app3 && streamlit run main.py --server.port 8504
   ```

4. **Configure in portal**:
   - Login as admin
   - Use "Scan for Unregistered Apps" to auto-discover
   - Register apps with proper names, descriptions, and categories
   - Create user groups and set permissions
   - Test access with different user accounts

### Development Guidelines
The project includes `.cursorrules` file with comprehensive development guidelines:
- **Multi-line editing**: Always use `edit_file` tool for multi-line changes
- **File encoding**: UTF-8 without BOM, consistent line endings
- **Code quality**: PEP 8 compliance, type hints, error handling
- **Performance**: Caching strategies, efficient database queries
- **Security**: Input validation, SQL injection prevention

## Security Features

### Enterprise-Grade Security
The Streamlit Portal implements multiple layers of security to protect against unauthorized access and ensure safe application deployment in enterprise environments.

### Multi-Layer Authentication
- **Session-Based Security**: Advanced session management with secure token validation
- **Anti-Sharing Protection**: URLs cannot be shared between users or browsers
- **Automatic Token Expiration**: Access tokens expire automatically and are single-use only
- **Session Binding**: All access is cryptographically tied to authenticated portal sessions
- **Logout Protection**: When users log out, all their active sessions become invalid immediately

### Secure Access Control
- **Portal Session Validation**: Database-backed session verification prevents unauthorized access
- **Token-to-Session Binding**: Access tokens are permanently linked to the portal session that created them
- **Cross-Platform Security**: Works reliably across different browsers and devices
- **Non-Repudiation**: Clear audit trail of who accessed what and when

### Application Protection
Each Streamlit application can be secured using the included security library:
```python
from portal_security import require_portal_access

# At the top of your Streamlit app
require_portal_access(app_id=1)  # Your app's ID from the portal database
```

### Security Best Practices

#### Authentication Security
- **bcrypt password hashing** with salt for secure storage
- **Session management** prevents unauthorized access
- **Role-based permissions** limit access based on user roles
- **Input validation** on all user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- **Secure session cookies** with HttpOnly and SameSite protection

#### Database Security  
- **Parameterized queries** prevent SQL injection
- **Foreign key constraints** maintain data integrity
- **Transaction safety** ensures atomic operations
- **Connection management** with proper cleanup
- **Session state protection** with database validation

#### Access Security
- **Group-based permissions** for granular access control
- **Public/private app designation** with clear security boundaries
- **Admin privilege separation** with protected account controls
- **Automatic session cleanup** removes expired sessions
- **Single-use tokens** prevent replay attacks

#### Network Security
- **Port scanning protection** with controlled discovery ranges
- **HTTP verification** ensures only legitimate applications are discovered
- **Cross-origin protection** prevents unauthorized embedding
- **Secure proxy architecture** with cookie-based session management

#### File Security
- **Image upload validation** (type, size restrictions)
- **Path sanitization** prevents directory traversal
- **Secure file storage** in designated directories
- **File type restrictions** with automatic processing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **"No apps found" / Empty Dashboard**
   - Verify Streamlit apps are running on expected ports
   - Check user has group permissions for apps
   - Confirm apps are registered in admin panel
   - Use "Scan for Unregistered Apps" to auto-discover

2. **Authentication Problems**
   - Verify username/password spelling and case sensitivity
   - Check user account is active (not disabled)
   - Try with default admin credentials
   - Check database permissions and file access

3. **Port Scanning Issues**
   - Ensure ports 8502-8600 are not blocked by firewall
   - Check if services are actually Streamlit apps (HTTP verification)
   - Clear scan cache if results seem stale
   - Verify multithreading isn't blocked by system limits

4. **Image Upload Problems**
   - Check `app_images/` directory is writable
   - Verify file format (PNG, JPG, JPEG only)
   - Ensure PIL/Pillow is correctly installed
   - Check file size limits (images are auto-resized)

5. **Database Errors**
   - Ensure directory is writable for SQLite file creation
   - Check `portal.db` file permissions
   - Verify no conflicting database connections
   - Restart application if database is locked

6. **Theme/UI Issues**
   - Verify `.streamlit/config.toml` file is present
   - Clear browser cache to refresh CSS
   - Check for JavaScript console errors
   - Ensure Streamlit version supports theme features
